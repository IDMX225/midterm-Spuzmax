                <h3>Oceana</h3>

                One our prospectors guiding a remote-controled robot as it investigates novel mineral resources on the planet Oceana. We discovered a vast supply of irridescent gloopies on this world which our client used to corner the market on shimmery eye-shadow in their quadrant of the galaxy.

              A robot miner, shown with our prospector, searching all over Hydrosia for an Enchanted Golden Apple. Our client was tired of looking for one in Minecraft, so he hired us to search for them on Hydrosia. We have delivered 42 as of last fiscal quarter.

              <h3>Aqualis</h3>

              Here's one of our prospectors with a miniature robot looking in all the nooks and crannies on Aqualis for something special. Our client made a fortune when we found an oradinous gel with a special property. When you put the gel on your eye, it allows you to see through any makeup, prosthetic or disguise someone is wearing on their face. A big hit with those who are engaged to be married!
